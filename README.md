#Self Organizing Maps Tutorial (SOM)
written by: Ciera Martinez

##About

This is a few ways in which to perform self organizing maps to perform gene co-expression clustering. The data is from an experiment in which 6 tissue types were taken from two different genotypes. 

##File Directory

`data` - Contains all the requisite data to run the scripts.
`pdf` - Tutorials in pdf format.
`Rmd` - The R markdown files with original code. 

There are 3 types analysis

1. SOMtutorial - Basic SOM, one genotype.
2. SOMtutorial_BothGenotypes - This is basic SOM using both genotypes. 
3. superSOMtutorial - Super SOM using both genotypes (The same genes are forced to be contained in the same clusters).
